\chapter{Configuration file}
\label{chap:configurationfile}

\arara\ provides a persistent model of modifying the underlying execution behaviour or enhance the execution workflow through the concept of a configuration file. This chapter provides the basic structure of such file, as well as details on the file lookup in the operating system.

\section{File lookup}
\label{sec:filelookup}

Our tool looks for the presence of at least one of four very specific files before execution. These files are presented as follows. Observe that the directories must have the correct permissions for proper lookup and access. The lookup order is also presented.

\end{tabular}

\vspace{1.4em}

From version 4.0 on, \arara\ provides two approaches regarding the location of a configuration file. They dictate how the execution should behave and happen from a user perspective, and are described as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[global configuration file] For this approach, the configuration file should be located at \abox[araracolour]{USER\_HOME} which is the home directory of the current user. All subsequent executions of \arara\ will read this configuration file and apply the specified settings accordingly. However, it is important to note that this approach has the lowest lookup priority, which means that a local configuration, presented as follows, will always supersede a global counterpart.

\item[local configuration file] For this approach, the configuration file should be located at \abox[araracolour]{USER\_DIR} which is the working directory associated with the current execution. Such directory can also be interpreted as the one relative to the processed file. This approach offers a project-based solution for complex workflows, e.g, a thesis or a book. However, \arara\ must be executed within the working directory, or the local configuration file lookup will fail. Observe that this approach has the highest lookup priority, which means that it will always supersede a global configuration.
\end{description}

\begin{messagebox}{Beware of empty configuration files}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
% TODO fix reference
A configuration file should never be empty, otherwise \arara\ will complain about it. Make sure to populate it with at least one key, or do not write a configuration file at all. The available options are described in Section~\ref{foo}, page~\pageref{foo}.
\end{messagebox}

% TODO fix reference
If the logging feature is properly enabled, \arara\ will indicate in the corresponding \rbox{arara.log} file whether a configuration file was used during the execution and, if so, the corresponding canonical, absolute path. Logging is detailed later on, in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}).

\section{Basic structure}
\label{sec:basicstructure}

The following list describes the basic structure of an \arara\ configuration file by presenting the proper elements (or keys, if we consider the proper YAML nomenclature). Observe that elements marked as \rbox[araracolour]{M} are mandatory (i.e, the configuration file \emph{has} to have them in order to work). Similarly, elements marked as \rbox[araracolour]{O} are optional, so you can safely ignore them when writing a configuration file for our tool.

\begin{description}
\item[\describe{M}{!config}] This keyword is mandatory and must be the first line of a configuration file. It denotes the object mapping metadata to be internally used by the tool. Actually, the tool is not too demanding on using it (in fact, you could suppress it entirely and \arara\ will not complain), but it is considered good practice to start a configuration file with a \abox{!config} keyword regardless.

\item[\describecf{O}{string list}{paths}] When looking for rules, \arara\ always searches the default rule path, which consists of a special subdirectory named \abox[araracolour]{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox[araracolour]{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). If no rule is found, the execution halts with an error. The \abox{paths} key specifies a list of directories, represented as plain strings, in which our tool should search for rules. The default path is appended to the list. Then the search happens from the first to the last element, in order.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
paths:
- '/home/paulo/rules'
- '/opt/paulo/rules'
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
There are three variables available in the \abox{paths} context and are described as follows (note that MVEL variables and orb tags are discussed in Chapter~\ref{foo}). A variable will be denoted by \varbox{variable} in this list.

\begin{description}
\item[\varbox{user.home}] This variable, as the name implies, holds the value of the absolute, canonical path of \abox[araracolour]{USER\_HOME} which is the home directory of the current user, as plain string. Note that the specifics of the home directory (such as name and location) are defined by the operating system involved.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
paths:
- '@{user.home}/rules'
\end{codebox}

\item[\varbox{user.dir}] This variable, as the name implies, holds the value of the absolute, canonical path of \abox[araracolour]{USER\_DIR} which is the working directory associated with the current execution, as plain string. Note that the working directory approach requires a user execution strategy to ensure the correct path value.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
paths:
- '@{user.dir}/rules'
\end{codebox}

\item[\varbox{user.name}] This variable, as the name implies, holds the value of the current user account name, as plain string. On certain operating systems, this value is used to build the home directory structure.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
paths:
- '/home/@{user.name}/rules'
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
Observe that the \varbox{user} variable actually holds a map containing three keys (resulting in a map within a map). However, for didatic purposes, it is easier to use the property navigation feature of MVEL, detailed in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}), and consider the map references as three independent variables. You can use property navigation styles interchangeably. Note that you can also precede the path with the special keyword \abox{<arara>} and save some quotes (see Section~\ref{foo}, page~\pageref{foo}). In this specific scenario, the special keyword will be automatically removed afterwards.

\begin{messagebox}{Avoid folded and literal styles for scalars in a path}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
Do not use folded or literal styles for scalars in a path! The orb tag resolution for a path in plain string should be kept as simple as possible, so \emph{always} use the inline style.
\end{messagebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{string}{language}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{en}] This variable sets the language of all subsequent executions of \arara\ according to the provided language code value, as plain string. The default language is set to English. Also, it is very important to observe that the \opbox{{-}language} command line option can override this setting.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
language: nl
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{integer}{loops}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{10}] This variable redefines the maximum number of loops \arara\ will allow for potentially infinite iterations. Any positive integer can be used as value for this variable. Also, it is very important to observe that the \opbox{{-}max-loops} command line option can override this setting.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
loops: 30
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{boolean}{verbose}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{false}] This variable activates or deactivates the verbose mode of \arara\ as default mode, according to the associated boolean value. Also, it is very important to observe that the \opbox{{-}verbose} command line option can override this setting if, and only if, this variable holds \rbox{false} as value.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
verbose: true
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{boolean}{logging}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{false}] This variable activates or deactivates the logging feature of \arara as the default behaviour, according to the associated boolean value. Also, it is very important to observe that the \opbox{{-}log} command line option can override this setting if, and only if, this variable holds \rbox{false} as value.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
logging: true
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{boolean}{header}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{false}] This variable modifies the directive extraction, according to the associated boolean value. If enabled, \arara\ will extract all directives from the beginning of the file until it reaches a line that is not empty and it is not a comment. Otherwise, the tool will resort to the default behaviour and extract all directives from the entire file. It is very important to observe that the \opbox{{-}header} command line option can override this setting if, and only if, this variable holds \rbox{false} as value.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
header: false
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecf{O}{string}{logname}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{arara}] This variable modifies the default log file name, according to the associated plain string value, plus the \rbox{log} extension. The value cannot be empty or contain invalid characters. There is no orb tag evaluation in this specific context, only a plain string value. The log file will be written by our tool if, and only if, the \opbox{{-}log} command line option is used.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
logname: mylog
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
\item[\describecf{O}{string}{dbname}\hfill {\normalfont\itshape default:} \rbox{arara}] This variable modifies the default XML database file name, according to the associated plain string value, plus the \rbox{xml} extension. The value cannot be empty or contain invalid characters. There is no orb tag evaluation in this specific context, only a plain string value. This databased is used by file hashing operations, detailed in Section~\ref{foo}, on page~\pageref{foo}.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
dbname: mydb
\end{codebox}
