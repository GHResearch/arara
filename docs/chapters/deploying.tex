\label{chap:deployingthetool}

% TODO fix reference
As previously mentioned, \arara\ runs on top of a Java virtual machine, available on all major operating systems -- in some cases, you might need to install the proper virtual machine. This chapter provides detailed instructions on how to properly deploy the tool in your computer from either the official package available in our project repository or a personal build generated from source (as seen in Section~\ref{foo}, on page~\pageref{foo}).

\begin{messagebox}{No more installers}{araracolour}{\icok}{white}
Be mindful that, from version 4.0 on, the team decided to not release cross-platform installers any more. Our tool is available out of the shelf on all major \TeX\ distributions, including \TeX\ Live and MiK\TeX, which makes manual installation unnecessary given the significant coverage of such distributions. Chances are you already have \arara\ in your system!
