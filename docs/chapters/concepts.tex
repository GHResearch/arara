\chapter{Important concepts}
\label{chap:importantconcepts}

Time for our first contact with \arara! I must strees that is very important to understand a few concepts in which \arara\ relies before we proceed to the usage itself. Do not worry, these concepts are easy to follow, yet they are vital to the comprehension of the application and the logic behind it.

\section{Rules}
\label{sec:rule}

A \emph{rule} is a formal description of how \arara\ handles a certain task. For instance, if we want to use \abox{pdflatex} with our tool, we should have a rule for that. Directives are mapped to rules, so a call to a nonexistent rule \abox{foo}, for instance, will indeed raise an error:

\begin{codebox}{Terminal}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
  __ _ _ __ __ _ _ __ __ _ 
 / _` | '__/ _` | '__/ _` |
| (_| | | | (_| | | | (_| |
 \__,_|_|  \__,_|_|  \__,_|

I could not find a rule named 'foo' in the provided rule paths.
Perhaps a misspelled word? I was looking for a file named
'foo.yaml' in the following paths in order of priority:
(/opt/paulo/arara/rules)

Total: 0.09 seconds
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
Once a rule is defined, \arara\ automatically provides an access layer to that rule through directives in the source code, a concept to be formally introduced later on, in Section~\ref{foo}. Observe that a directive reflects a particular instance of a rule of the same name (i.e, a \abox{foo} directive in a certain source code is an instance of the \abox{foo} rule).

In short, a rule is a plain text file written in the YAML format, introduced in Chapter~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}). I opted for this format because back then it was cleaner and more intuitive to use than other markup languages such as XML, besides of course being a data serialization standard for programming languages.

\begin{messagebox}{Animal jokes}{araracolour}{\icok}{white}
As a bonus, the acronym \emph{YAML} rhymes with the word \emph{camel}, so \arara\ is heavily environmentally friendly. Speaking of camels, there is the programming reference as well, since this amusing animal is usually associated with Perl and friends.
\end{messagebox}

% TODO fix reference
The default rules, that is, the rules shipped with \arara, are placed inside a special subdirectory named \abox[araracolour]{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox[araracolour]{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). We will learn later on, in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}), that we can add an arbitrary number of paths for storing our own rules, in order of priority, so do not worry too much with the location of the default rules, although it is important to understand and acknowledge their existance.

The following list describes the basic structure of an \arara\ rule by presenting the proper elements (or keys, if we consider the proper YAML nomenclature). Observe that elements marked as \rbox[araracolour]{M} are mandatory (i.e, the rule \emph{has} to have them in order to work). Similarly, elements marked as \rbox[araracolour]{O} are optional, so you can safely ignore them when writing a rule for our tool. A key preceded by \rbox{context$\rightarrow$} indicates a context and should be properly defined inside it.

\begin{description}
\item[\describe{M}{!config}] This keyword is mandatory and must be the first line of any \arara\ rule. It denotes the object mapping metadata to be internally used by the tool. Actually, the tool is not too demanding on using it (in fact, you could suppress it entirely and \arara\ will not complain), but it is considered good practice to start all rules with a \abox{!config} keyword regardless.

\item[\describe{M}{identifier}] This key acts as a unique identifier for the rule (as expected). It is highly recommended to use lowercase letters without spaces, accents or punctuation symbols, as good practice (again). As a convention, if you have an identifier named \abox{pdflatex}, the rule filename must be \abox{pdflatex.yaml} (like our own instance). Please note that, although \abox{.yml} is known to be a valid YAML extension as well, \arara\ only considers files ending with the \abox{.yaml} extension. This is a deliberate decision.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
identifier: pdflatex
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{M}{name}] This key holds the name of the task as a plain string. When running \arara, this value will be displayed in the output. We like to call \emph{task} an instantiated rule (through a directive). Task names are displayed enclosed in parenthesis.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
name: PDFLaTeX
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{O}{authors}] We do love blaming people, so \arara\ features a special key to name the rule authors (if any) so you can write stern electronic communications to them! This key holds a list of strings. If the rule has just one author, add it as the first (and only) element of the list.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
authors:
- Marco Daniel
- Paulo Cereda
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{M}{commands}] This key is introduced in version 4.0 of \arara\ and denotes a potential list of commands. From the user perspective, each command is called \emph{subtask} within a task (rule and directive) context. A task may represent only a single command (a single subtask), as well as a sequence of commands (subtasks). For instance, the \abox{frontespizio} rule requires at least two commands. So, as a means of normalizing the representation, a task composed of a single command (single subtask) is defined as the only element of such list, as opposed to previous versions of \arara, which had an specific key to hold just one command.

\begin{messagebox}{Incompatibility with older versions}{attentioncolour}{\icerror}{black}
Dear reader, note that rules from version 4.0 are incompatible with older versions of \arara. If you are migrating from old versions to version 4.0, we need to replace \abox{command} by \abox{commands} and specifying a contextual element, as seen in the following descriptions. Please refer to Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}) for a comprehensible migration guide.
\end{messagebox}

In order to properly set a subtask, the keys used in this specification are defined inside the \rbox{commands$\rightarrow$} context and presented as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[\describecontext{O}{commands}{name}] This key holds the name of the subtask as a plain string. When running \arara, this value will be displayed in the output. Subtask names are displayed after the main task name. By the way, did you notice that this key is entirely optional? That means that a subtask can simply be unnamed, if you decide so. However, such practice is not recommended, as is always good to have a visual description of what \arara\ is running at the moment, so name your subtasks properly.

\item[\describecontext{M}{commands}{command}] This key holds the action to be performed, typically a system command. In previous versions, \arara\ would rely solely on a string. For this version on, as a means to enhance the user experience (and also fix serious blockers when handling spaces in file names, as seen in \href{https://github.com/cereda/arara/issues}{previous issues} reported in the repository), the tool offers four types of returned values:

\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
\item A plain string: this is the default (and only) behaviour in older versions of \arara. The plain string is processed as it is by the underlying execution engine. However, automatic argument parsing poses as a complex issue, so this approach, although supported, is not recommended anymore.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: 'ls'
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
It is important to observe that you can use either a plain string directly or using an orb tag with an explicit \abox{return} command (as seen in Section~\ref{foo}, page~\pageref{foo}). Personally, I favour the explict indication for a quick understanding.

% TODO fix reference
\item A \abox{Command} object: \arara\ 4.0 features a new approach for handling system commands based on a high level structure with explict argument parsing named \abox{Command} (for our curious users, it is a plain Java object). In order to use this approach, we need to rely on orb tags and use a helper method named \mtbox{getCommand} to obtain the desired result. We will detail this method later on, in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}). We highly recommend the adoption of this approach for rule writing instead of using plain strings.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: "@{ return getCommand('ls') }"
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
\item A boolean value: it is also possible to exploit the expressive power of the underlying scripting language available in the rule context (see Chapter~\ref{foo}, in page~\pageref{foo}, for more details) for writing complex code. In this particular case, since the computation is being done by \arara\ itself and not the underlying operating system, there will not be a command to be executed, so simply return a boolean value -- either an explicit \abox{true} or \abox{false} value or a logical expression -- to indicate whether the computation was successfull.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: "@{ return 1 == 1 }"
\end{codebox}

\item A \abox{Trigger} object: this is surely the least common type of returned value and it is mentioned here just for documentation purposes. In simple terms, a \abox{Trigger} object constitutes a special command that changes the internal workings of \arara\ at runtime. We have not worked much on this concept, so there is only one trigger available, seen in action in the official \abox{halt} rule. In order to use this approach, we need to rely on orb tags and use a helper method named \mtbox{getTrigger} to obtain the desired result.
\end{itemize}

It is also worth mentioning that \arara\ also supports lists of commands represented as plain strings, \abox{Command} or \abox{Trigger} objects, boolean values or a mix of them. This is useful if your rule has to decide whether more actions are required in order to accomplish a task. In this case, our tool will take care of the list and execute each element in the specified order.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: "@{ return [ 'ls', 'ls', 'ls' ] }"
\end{codebox}

As an example, please refer to the official \abox{clean} rule for a real scenario where a list of commands is successfully employed: for each provided extension, the rule creates a new cleaning command and adds it to a list of removals to be processed later.

\begin{messagebox}{Plain string is deprecated}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
It took me a lot of effort to find out that handling plain strings and employing guesswork to parse arguments are the root of several issues reported by users. Therefore, this approach is being marked as \emph{deprecated} and will be removed in future versions.
\end{messagebox}

% TODO fix reference
There are at least two variables available in the \abox{command} context and are described as follows (note that MVEL variables and orb tags are discussed in Chapter~\ref{foo}). A variable will be denoted by \varbox{variable} in this list. For each rule argument (defined later on), there will be a corresponding variable in the \abox{command} context, directly accessed through its unique identifier.

\begin{description}
\item[\varbox{file}] This variable holds the file name, without any path reference, as a plain string. It is usually composed by the base name and the extension. This variable is available since the first release of \arara.

\item[\varbox{reference}] This variable is introduced in version 4.0 of \arara\ and holds the canonical, absolute path representation of the \varbox{file} variable as a \abox{File} object. This is useful if there is a need of understanding the hierarchical structure of a project. Since the reference is a Java object, we can use all methods available in the \abox{File} class.
\end{description}

\begin{messagebox}{Quote handling}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
\setlength{\parskip}{1em}
The YAML format disallows key values starting with \abox{@} without proper quoting. This is the reason we had to use double quotes for the value and internally using single quotes for the command string. Also, we could use the other way around, or even using only one type and then escaping them when needed. This is excessively verbose but needed due to the format requirement. Thankfully, \arara\ offers two solutions for removing the quoting verbosity when writing commands.

The first solution is used in previous versions and it still works like a charm in modern days. We need to precede our command with a special keyword \abox{<arara>} which will be removed afterwards. This solution works on virtually every key in the rule context, so it is a bonus. The new code will look like this:

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: <arara> @{ return getCommand('ls') }
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
The second approach is more of a YAML feature rather than a tool exclusive, although we have to do a couple of checkings under the hood in order to ensure the correct execution. The idea here is to use the scalar content in folded style, as seen in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}). The new code will look like this:

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
command: >
  @{
    return getCommand('ls')
  }
\end{codebox}

Mind the indentation, as YAML requires it to properly identify blocks. I personally recommend this approach for longer code, as it provides a better visual representation. You will see the second solution all around the default rules, but feel free to use the one you feel more comfortable.
\end{messagebox}

\item[\describecontext{O}{commands}{exit}] This key holds a special purpose in \arara\ 4.0, as it represents a custom exit status evaluation for the corresponding command. In general, a successful execution has zero as an exit status, but sometimes we end up with tools or situations that we need to override this checking for whatever reason. For this purpose, simply write a MVEL expression \emph{without orb tags} as plain string and use the special variable \varbox{value} if you need the actual exit status returned by the command, available at runtime. For example, if the command returns a non-zero value indicating a successful execution, we can write this key as:

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
exit: value > 0
\end{codebox}

If the execution should be marked as successful by \arara\ regardless of the actual exit status, you can simply write \abox{true} as the key value and this rule will never fail, for obvious reasons.
\end{description}

For instance, consider a full example of the \abox{commands} key, defined with only one command, presented as follows. The hyphen denotes a list element, so mind the indentation for correctly specifying the component keys. Also, note that, in this case, the \abox{exit} key was completely optional, as it does the default checking, and it was included for didactic purposes.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
commands:
- name: The PDFLaTeX engine
  command: >
    @{
      return getCommand('pdflatex', file)
    }
  exit: value == 0
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{M}{arguments}] This key holds a list of arguments for the current rule, if any. The arguments specified in this list will be available to the user later on for potential completion through directives. Once instantiated, they will become proper variables in the \abox{command} contexts. This key is mandatory, so even if your rule does not have arguments, you need to specify a list regardless. In this case, use the empty list notation:

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
arguments: []
\end{codebox}

In order to properly set an argument, the keys used in this specification are defined inside the \rbox{arguments$\rightarrow$} context and presented as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[\describecontext{M}{arguments}{identifier}] This key acts as a unique identifier for the argument. It is highly recommended to use lowercase letters without spaces, accents or punctuation symbols, as a good practice. This key will be used later on to set the corresponding value in the directive context.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
identifier: shell
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecontext{O}{arguments}{flag}] This key holds a plain string and is evaluated when the corresponding argument is defined in the directive context.  After being evaluated, the result will be stored in a variable of the same name to be later accessed in the \abox{command} context. In the scenario where the argument is not defined in the directive, the variable will hold an empty string.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
flag: >
  @{
      isTrue(parameters.shell, '--shell-escape',
             '--no-shell-escape')
  }
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
There is one variable available in the \abox{flag} context and is described as follows. Note that are also several helper methods available in the rule context (for instance, \mtbox{isTrue} presented in the previous example) which provide interesting features for rule writing. They are detailed later on, in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}).

\begin{description}
\item[\varbox{parameters}] This variable holds a map of directive parameters available at runtime. For each argument identifier listed in the \abox{arguments} list in the rule context, there will be an entry in this variable. This is useful to get the actual values provided during execution and take proper actions. If a parameter is not set in the directive context, the reference will still exist in the map, but it will be mapped to an empty string.
\end{description}

In the previous example, observe that the MVEL expression defined in the \abox{flag} key checks if the user provided an affirmative value regarding shell escape, through comparing \varbox{parameters.shell} with a set of predefined affirmative values. In any case, the corresponding command flag is defined as result of such evaluation.

\item[\describecontext{O}{arguments}{default}] As default behaviour, if a parameter is not set in the directive context, the reference will be mapped to an empty string. This key exists for the exact purpose of overriding such behaviour and expects a plain string as value.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
default: ''
\end{codebox}

\item[\describecontext{O}{arguments}{required}] There might be certain scenarios in which a rule could make use of required arguments (for instance, a copy operation in which source and target must be provided). The \abox{required} key acts as a boolean switch to indicate whether the corresponding argument should be mandatory. In this case, set the key value to \abox{true} and the argument turns required. Later on at runtime, \arara\ will throw an error if a required parameter is missing in the directive.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
required: false
\end{codebox}

Note that setting the \abox{required} key value to \abox{false} corresponds to omitting the key completely in the rule context, which resorts to the default behaviour (i.e, all arguments are optional).
\end{description}

\begin{messagebox}{Note on argument keys}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
As seen previously, both \abox{flag} and \abox{default} are marked as optional, but at least one of them must occur in the argument specification, otherwise \arara\ will throw an error, as it makes no sense to have no argument handling at all. Please make sure to specify at least one of them!
\end{messagebox}

For instance, consider a full example of the \abox{arguments} key, defined with only one argument, presented as follows. The hyphen denotes a list element, so mind the indentation for correctly specifying the component keys. Also, note that, in this case, keys \abox{required} and \abox{default} were completely optional, and they were included for didactic purposes.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
arguments:
- identifier: shell
  flag: >
    @{
        isTrue(parameters.shell, '--shell-escape',
               '--no-shell-escape')
    }
  required: false
  default: ''
\end{codebox}
\end{description}

% TODO fix reference
This is the rule structure in the YAML format used by \arara. Keep in mind that all subtasks in a rule are checked against their corresponding exit status. If an abnormal execution is detected, the tool will instantly halt and the rule will fail. Even \arara\ itself will return an exit code different than zero when this situation happens (detailed in Section~\ref{foo}, in page~\pageref{foo}).

\section{Directives}
\label{sec:directives}

%A \emph{directive} is a special comment inserted in the
%source file in which you indicate how \arara\ should
%behave. You can insert as many directives as you
%want and in any position of the file. The tool will
%read the whole file and extract the directives.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{New features in version 4.0}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%\textbf{Partial directive extraction} -- From version 4.0 on,
%it is now possible to extract directives only available in the
%file preamble, that is, all lines from the beginning that are
%comments until reaching the first line that is not a comment.
%To this end, a new command line flag is introduced. We will
%discuss this feature later on.
%
%\vspace{1em}
%
%\textbf{Predefined preambles} -- It is now possible to set up
%a common preamble to be used with files that require the same
%automation steps, then \arara\ can be invoked based on such
%specifications. We will discuss this feature later on.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%There are two types of directives in \arara. The first one has
%already been mentioned, it has only the rule name (which refers 
%to the \verb|identifier| key from the rule of the same name). It 
%is called \emph{empty directive}:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Empty directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex
%\end{codebox}
%
%Sometimes, however, we need to provide additional information to 
%the rule. That is reason for the second type, the 
%\emph{parametrized directive}, to exist. As the name indicates, 
%we have directive arguments! They are mapped by their identifiers
%and not by their positions. The syntax for a parametrized 
%directive is:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Parametrized directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
%\end{codebox}
%
%Each argument is defined according to the rule mapped by the 
%directive. This means you cannot use an argument \verb|foo| in a 
%directive \verb|bar| if the rule \verb|bar| does not offer 
%support for it (that is, \verb|bar| has to have \verb|foo| 
%defined as argument in its list of arguments inside the rule 
%scope, as seen in the previous section). The syntax for
%an argument is:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Argument syntax}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%key : value
%\end{codebox}
%
%Suppose we would like to enable shell escape for \verb|pdflatex| 
%when compiling a \verb|hello.tex| file. We can achieve that by 
%providing a parametrized directive, like this one:
%
%\begin{codebox}{\texttt{hello.tex} with a parametrized directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
%
%\documentclass{article}
%\begin{document}
%Hello world!
%\end{document}
%\end{codebox}
%
%Of course, the \verb|shell| argument is defined in the
%\verb|pdflatex| rule scope, otherwise \arara\ would raise
%an error about an invalid argument key. If we try to
%inject a nonexistent \verb|foo| argument in the previous 
%parametrized directive, we will get this message:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Terminal}{teal}{\icnote}{white}

%\begin{messagebox}{Helpful messages}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%Make sure to read all messages \arara\ raises, they will help

%\end{messagebox}
%
%Sometimes, directives can span several columns of a line, 
%particularly the ones with several arguments. From \arara\ 4.0 
%on, we can split a directive into multiple lines by adding
%\verb|% arara: -->| to each line which should compose the
%directive:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Multiline directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: {
%% arara: --> shell: yes,
%% arara: --> synctex: yes
%% arara: --> }
%\end{codebox}
%
%It is important to observe that there is no need of them to be
%in contiguous lines, that is, provided that the syntax for
%parametrized directives hold for the line composition, lines can
%be distributed all over the code.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{New feature in version 4.0}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%\textbf{Conditionals} -- From version 4.0 on, \arara\ provides
%logical expressions processed at runtime to determine whether
%and  how a directive should be processed. This is a huge 
%improvement towards better user experience.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%One of the most awaited features that version 4.0 introduces is 
%the support of conditionals, that is, logical expressions 
%processed at runtime in order to determine whether and how the 
%directive should be processed. The following types are allowed:
%
%\begin{keywords}
%\item[if] evaluated beforehand, the directive is interpreted
%if and only if the result is true.
%
%\item[unless] evaluated beforehand, the directive
%is interpreted if and only if the result is false.
%
%\item[until] directive is interpreted the first time,
%then the evaluation is done; while the result
%is false, the directive is interpreted again and
%again.
%
%\item[while] evaluated beforehand, the directive is
%interpreted if and only if the result is true,
%and the process is repeated while the result
%still holds true.
%\end{keywords}
%
%We will discuss this special feature later on, including methods
%available in the directive scope in order to ease the writing
%of conditionals, as it would be highly advisable to have
%orb tags covered beforehand.
