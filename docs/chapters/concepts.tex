\chapter{Important concepts}
\label{chap:importantconcepts}

Time for our first contact with \arara! I must strees that is very important to understand a few concepts in which \arara\ relies before we proceed to the usage itself. Do not worry, these concepts are easy to follow, yet they are vital to the comprehension of the application and the logic behind it.

\section{Rules}
\label{sec:rule}

A \emph{rule} is a formal description of how \arara\ handles a certain task. For instance, if we want to use \abox{pdflatex} with our tool, we should have a rule for that. Directives are mapped to rules, so a call to a nonexistent rule \abox{foo}, for instance, will indeed raise an error:

\begin{codebox}{Terminal}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
  __ _ _ __ __ _ _ __ __ _ 
 / _` | '__/ _` | '__/ _` |
| (_| | | | (_| | | | (_| |
 \__,_|_|  \__,_|_|  \__,_|

I could not find a rule named 'foo' in the provided rule paths.
Perhaps a misspelled word? I was looking for a file named
'foo.yaml' in the following paths in order of priority:
(/opt/paulo/arara/rules)

Total: 0.09 seconds
\end{codebox}

% TODO fix reference
Once a rule is defined, \arara\ automatically provides an access layer to that rule through directives in the source code, a concept to be formally introduced later on, in Section~\ref{foo}. Observe that a directive reflects a particular instance of a rule of the same name (i.e, a \abox{foo} directive in a certain source code is an instance of the \abox{foo} rule).

In short, a rule is a plain text file written in the YAML format, introduced in Chapter~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}). I opted for this format because back then it was cleaner and more intuitive to use than other markup languages such as XML, besides of course being a data serialization standard for programming languages.

\begin{messagebox}{Animal jokes}{araracolour}{\icok}{white}
As a bonus, the acronym \emph{YAML} rhymes with the word \emph{camel}, so \arara\ is heavily environmentally friendly. Speaking of camels, there is the programming reference as well, since this amusing animal is usually associated with Perl and friends.
\end{messagebox}

% TODO fix reference
The default rules, that is, the rules shipped with \arara, are placed inside a special subdirectory named \abox{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). We will learn later on, in Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}), that we can add an arbitrary number of paths for storing our own rules, in order of priority, so do not worry too much with the location of the default rules, although it is important to understand and acknowledge their existance.

The following list describes the basic structure of an \arara\ rule by presenting the proper elements (or keys, if we consider the proper YAML nomenclature). Observe that elements marked as \abox[araracolour]{M} are mandatory (i.e, the rule \emph{has} to have them in order to work). Similarly, elements marked as \abox[araracolour]{O} are optional, so you can safely ignore them when writing a rule for our tool. A key preceded by \rbox{context$\rightarrow$} indicates a context and should be properly defined inside it.

\begin{description}
\item[\describe{M}{!config}] This keyword is mandatory and must be the first line of any \arara\ rule. It denotes the object mapping metadata to be internally used by the tool. Actually, the tool is not too demanding on using it (in fact, you could suppress it entirely and \arara\ will not complain), but it is considered good practice to start all rules with a \abox{!config} keyword regardless.

\item[\describe{M}{identifier}] This key acts as a unique identifier for the rule (as expected). It is highly recommended to use lowercase letters without spaces, accents or punctuation symbols, as good practice (again). As a convention, if you have an identifier named \abox{pdflatex}, the rule filename must be \abox{pdflatex.yaml} (like our own instance). Please note that, although \abox{.yml} is known to be a valid YAML extension as well, \arara\ only considers files ending with the \abox{.yaml} extension. This is a deliberate decision.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
identifier: pdflatex
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{M}{name}] This key holds the name of the task as a plain string. When running \arara, this value will be displayed in the output. We like to call \emph{task} an instantiated rule (through a directive). Task names are displayed enclosed in parenthesis.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
name: PDFLaTeX
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{O}{authors}] We do love blaming people, so \arara\ features a special key to name the rule authors (if any) so you can write stern electronic communications to them! This key holds a list of strings. If the rule has just one author, add it as the first (and only) element of the list.

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
authors:
- Marco Daniel
- Paulo Cereda
\end{codebox}

\item[\describe{M}{commands}] This key is introduced in version 4.0 of \arara\ and denotes a potential list of commands. From the user perspective, each command is called \emph{subtask} within a task (rule and directive) context. A task may represent only a single command (a single subtask), as well as a sequence of commands (subtasks). For instance, the \abox{frontespizio} rule requires at least two commands. So, as a means of normalizing the representation, a task composed of a single command (single subtask) is defined as the only element of such list, as opposed to previous versions of \arara, which had an specific key to hold just one command.

\begin{messagebox}{Incompatibilities with older versions}{attentioncolour}{\icerror}{black}
Dear reader, note that rules from version 4.0 are incompatible with older versions of \arara. If you are migrating from old versions to version 4.0, we need to replace \abox{command} by \abox{commands} and specifying a contextual element, as seen in the following descriptions. Please refer to Section~\ref{foo} (page~\pageref{foo}) for a comprehensible migration guide.
\end{messagebox}

The keys used in this specification are defined inside the \rbox{commands$\rightarrow$} context and presented as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[\describecontext{O}{commands}{name}] This key holds the name of the subtask as a plain string. When running \arara, this value will be displayed in the output. Subtask names are displayed after the main task name. By the way, did you notice that this key is entirely optional? That means that a subtask can simply be unnamed, if you decide so. However, such practice is not recommended, as is always good to have a visual description of what \arara\ is running at the moment, so name your subtasks properly.

\item[\describecontext{M}{commands}{command}] 
\end{description}

%\item 
%
%\item The \verb|commands| key is introduced in version 4.0 of
%\arara\ and denotes a potential list of subtasks. A task may
%represent only a single command, as well as a sequence of
%commands (for example, the \verb|frontespizio| rule requires
%at least two commands). So, as a means of normalizing the
%representation, a task composed of a single command (like
%the one in our example) is defined as the only element
%of such list. The keys used inside this list specification
%are defined as follows. A list element is denoted by \verb|-|
%(hyphen).
%
%\item The \verb|name| key has no relation with the previously
%presented key of the same name. In this specific context,
%this key holds the subtask name. When running \arara\, this
%value will be displayed in the output right after the
%task name.
%
%\item The \verb|command| key contains the system command to be
%executed. You can use virtually any type of command,
%interactive or noninteractive. But beware: if \arara\ is
%running in silent mode, which is the default behaviour,
%an interactive command wich might require the user
%input will be halted and the execution will fail.
%Do not despair, you can use a special \verb|--verbose|
%flag with \arara\ in order to interact with such
%commands -- we will talk about flags later on. You probably
%noticed a strange element \verb|@{file}| in the
%\verb|command| line: this element is called \emph{orb tag}.
%For now, just admit these elements exist. We will come back
%to them later on, I promise.
%
%\item The \verb|arguments| key denotes a list of arguments
%for the subtask command. In our example, we have an empty
%list, denoted by \verb|[]|. You can define as many arguments
%as your subtask requires.
%\end{linedescription}
%
%For more complex rules, we might want to use arguments.
%The following code presents a new rule which makes use
%of them instead of an empty list as the previous code:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Adding rule arguments}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%!config
%identifier: copy
%name: Copy
%commands:
%- name: Copy operation
%  command: copy @{from} @{to}
%arguments:
%- identifier: from
%  flag: '@{parameters.from}'
%- identifier: to
%  flag: '@{parameters.to}'
%\end{codebox}
%
%For every argument in the \verb|arguments| list, we have a
%\verb|-| mark (hyphen) and proper indentation. Let us break down the relevant parts of this new rule:
%
%\begin{linedescription}[start=8]
%\item The \verb|identifier| key acts as a unique identifier
%for the current argument. It is highly recommended to use
%lowercase letters without spaces, accents or punctuation
%symbols.
%
%\item The \verb|flag| key represents the argument value.
%Note that we have other orb tags in the argument
%definitions, \verb|@{parameters.from}| and
%\verb|@{parameters.to}|; we will discuss them later on. Just
%to give some context, \verb|parameters| is a special variable
%which maps the elements available in the directive being
%evaluated. For example, if we have \verb|from: a| in a
%directive, \verb|parameters.from|  will resolve to \verb|a|.
%The argument \verb|flag| value is only applied if, and only
%if, there is an explicit directive argument. Say, if
%\verb|from| is not defined as a directive argument, the
%\verb|flag| value of argument \verb|from| will be
%resolved to an empty string.
%\end{linedescription}
%
%\begin{messagebox}{Overriding the default resolution of nonexistent arguments}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%If a certain argument does not exist in the directive, its
%rule counterpart will be resolved to an empty string, as the
%default resolution. As a means to overriding this behaviour
%when a directive argument is not specified, use the \verb|default| key within the argument specification.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%When a rule argument just needs a default value regardless of
%a user-specified value, you can safely ignore the \verb|flag|
%key and rely on the \verb|default| one. Similarly, if you need
%to map a directive argument into a rule argument without falling 
%back to a default value different than an empty string, 
%just use the \verb|flag| key. Now, if you need mapping and 
%fallback, stick with both keys. Just keep in mind that at least 
%one of them must exist!
%
%\begin{messagebox}{New feature in version 4.0}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%\textbf{Required arguments} -- Sometimes, we might end up with
%a rule in need of mandatory arguments. For instance, the
%two arguments of our \verb|copy| should be mandatory, as it makes
%no sense to have optional values for a copy operation. In this
%case, add a \verb|required| key to the relevant argument and set 
%the corresponding value to \verb|true| (a boolean value). Setting
%such value to \verb|false| would fallback to the default
%behaviour.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%All subtasks in a rule are checked against their corresponding
%exit status. If an abnormal execution is detected, \arara\ will
%instantly halt.
%
%For now, we need to keep in mind that \arara\ uses rules to tell
%it how to do a certain task (and subtasks). In the next sections,
%when more concepts are presented, we will come back to this
%subject. Just a taste of things to come, as we mentioned before
%already: directives are mapped to rules through orb tags. Do not
%worry, I will explain how things work.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{There are better ways of writing a rule}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
%This section covered the simplest way of writing an \arara\ rule,
%solely for didactic (and also historical) reasons. Keep in mind that there are far better and ways to achieve consistent rules. We
%need to discuss more about the basics before entering into
%advanced topics.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%\section{Directives}
%\label{sec:directives}
%
%A \emph{directive} is a special comment inserted in the
%source file in which you indicate how \arara\ should
%behave. You can insert as many directives as you
%want and in any position of the file. The tool will
%read the whole file and extract the directives.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{New features in version 4.0}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%\textbf{Partial directive extraction} -- From version 4.0 on,
%it is now possible to extract directives only available in the
%file preamble, that is, all lines from the beginning that are
%comments until reaching the first line that is not a comment.
%To this end, a new command line flag is introduced. We will
%discuss this feature later on.
%
%\vspace{1em}
%
%\textbf{Predefined preambles} -- It is now possible to set up
%a common preamble to be used with files that require the same
%automation steps, then \arara\ can be invoked based on such
%specifications. We will discuss this feature later on.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%There are two types of directives in \arara. The first one has
%already been mentioned, it has only the rule name (which refers 
%to the \verb|identifier| key from the rule of the same name). It 
%is called \emph{empty directive}:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Empty directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex
%\end{codebox}
%
%Sometimes, however, we need to provide additional information to 
%the rule. That is reason for the second type, the 
%\emph{parametrized directive}, to exist. As the name indicates, 
%we have directive arguments! They are mapped by their identifiers
%and not by their positions. The syntax for a parametrized 
%directive is:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Parametrized directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
%\end{codebox}
%
%Each argument is defined according to the rule mapped by the 
%directive. This means you cannot use an argument \verb|foo| in a 
%directive \verb|bar| if the rule \verb|bar| does not offer 
%support for it (that is, \verb|bar| has to have \verb|foo| 
%defined as argument in its list of arguments inside the rule 
%scope, as seen in the previous section). The syntax for
%an argument is:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Argument syntax}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%key : value
%\end{codebox}
%
%Suppose we would like to enable shell escape for \verb|pdflatex| 
%when compiling a \verb|hello.tex| file. We can achieve that by 
%providing a parametrized directive, like this one:
%
%\begin{codebox}{\texttt{hello.tex} with a parametrized directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
%
%\documentclass{article}
%\begin{document}
%Hello world!
%\end{document}
%\end{codebox}
%
%Of course, the \verb|shell| argument is defined in the
%\verb|pdflatex| rule scope, otherwise \arara\ would raise
%an error about an invalid argument key. If we try to
%inject a nonexistent \verb|foo| argument in the previous 
%parametrized directive, we will get this message:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Terminal}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%  __ _ _ __ __ _ _ __ __ _ 
% / _` | '__/ _` | '__/ _` |
%| (_| | | | (_| | | | (_| |

%
%I have spotted an error in rule 'pdflatex' located at
%'/opt/paulo/arara/rules'. I found these unknown keys
%in the directive: (foo). This should be an easy fix,
%just remove them from your map.
%
%Total: 0.21 seconds
%\end{codebox}
%
%As the message suggests, we need to remove the unknown argument 
%key from our directive or rewrite the rule in order to include 
%it. The first option is, of course, easier.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{Helpful messages}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%Make sure to read all messages \arara\ raises, they will help 
%you!
%\end{messagebox}
%
%Sometimes, directives can span several columns of a line, 
%particularly the ones with several arguments. From \arara\ 4.0 
%on, we can split a directive into multiple lines by adding
%\verb|% arara: -->| to each line which should compose the
%directive:
%
%\begin{codebox}{Multiline directive}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
%% arara: pdflatex: {
%% arara: --> shell: yes,
%% arara: --> synctex: yes
%% arara: --> }
%\end{codebox}
%
%It is important to observe that there is no need of them to be
%in contiguous lines, that is, provided that the syntax for
%parametrized directives hold for the line composition, lines can
%be distributed all over the code.
%
%\begin{messagebox}{New feature in version 4.0}{araracolour}{\icinfo}{white}
%\textbf{Conditionals} -- From version 4.0 on, \arara\ provides
%logical expressions processed at runtime to determine whether
%and  how a directive should be processed. This is a huge 
%improvement towards better user experience.
%\end{messagebox}
%
%One of the most awaited features that version 4.0 introduces is 
%the support of conditionals, that is, logical expressions 
%processed at runtime in order to determine whether and how the 
%directive should be processed. The following types are allowed:
%
%\begin{keywords}
%\item[if] evaluated beforehand, the directive is interpreted
%if and only if the result is true.
%
%\item[unless] evaluated beforehand, the directive
%is interpreted if and only if the result is false.
%
%\item[until] directive is interpreted the first time,
%then the evaluation is done; while the result
%is false, the directive is interpreted again and
%again.
%
%\item[while] evaluated beforehand, the directive is
%interpreted if and only if the result is true,
%and the process is repeated while the result
%still holds true.
%\end{keywords}
%
%We will discuss this special feature later on, including methods
%available in the directive scope in order to ease the writing
%of conditionals, as it would be highly advisable to have
%orb tags covered beforehand.
