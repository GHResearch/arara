\chapter{The official rule pack}
\label{chap:theofficialrulepack}

\arara\ ships with a pack of default rules, placed inside a special subdirectory named \abox[araracolour]{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox[araracolour]{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). This chapter introduces the official rules, including proper listings and descriptions of associated parameters whenever applied. Note that such rules work out of the shelf, without any special installation, configuration or modification. An option marked by \rbox[araracolour]{S} after the corresponding identifier indicates a natural boolean switch.

\begin{messagebox}{Can my rule be distributed within the official pack?}{araracolour}{\icok}{white}
% TODO fix reference
As seen in Section~\ref{foo}, on page~\pageref{foo}, the default rule path can be extended to include a list of directories in which our tool should search for rules. However, if you believe your rule is comprehensive enough and deserves to be in the official pack, please contact us! We will be more  than happy to discuss the inclusion of your rule in forthcoming updates.

\begin{description}
\item[\rulebox{animate}{Chris Hughes, Paulo Cereda}]
This rule creates an animated \rbox{gif} file from the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with the \rbox{pdf} suffix, using the \rbox{convert} command line utility from the ImageMagick suite.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpbox{delay}{10}] This option regulates the number of ticks before the display of the next image sequence, acting as a pause between still frames.

\item[\rpbox{loop}{0}] This option regulates the number of repetitions for the animation. When set to zero, the animation repeats itself an infinite number of times.

\item[\rpbox{density}{300}] This option specifies the horizontal and vertical canvas resolution while rendering vector formats into a proper raster image.

\item[\rpbox{program}{convert}] This option specifies the command utility path as a means to avoid potential clashes with underlying operating system commands.

\begin{messagebox}{Microsoft Windows woes}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
\setlength{\parskip}{1em}
According to the \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/}{ImageMagick website}, the Windows installation routine adds the program directory to the system path, such that one can call command line tools directly from the command prompt, without providing a path name. However, \rbox{convert} is also the name of Windows system tool, located in the system directory, which converts file systems from one format to another.

The best solution to avoid possible future name conflicts, according to the ImageMagick team, is to call such command line tools by their full path in any script. Therefore, the \rbox{convert} rule provides the \abox{program} option for this specific scenario.
\end{messagebox}

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{bib2gls}{Nicola Talbot, Paulo Cereda}] This rule executes the \rbox{bib2gls} command line application which extract glossary information stored in a \rbox{bib} file and converts it into glossary entry definitions in resource files.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{dir}] This option sets the directory used for writing auxiliary files. Note that this option does not change the current working directory.

\item[\abox{trans}] This option sets the name of the transcript file. By default, the name is the same as the \rbox{aux} file but with a \rbox{glg} extension.

\item[\abox{locale}] This option specifies the preferred language resource file. Please keep in mind that the provided value must be a valid \gls{IETF} language tag.

\item[\rpsbox{group}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will try to determine the letter group for each entry and add it to a new field called \rbox{group} when sorting. Be mindful that some \rbox{sort} options ignore this setting.

\item[\rpsbox{interpret}] This option sets whether the interpreter mode of \rbox{bib2gls} is enabled. If the interpreter is off, the transcript file will not be parsed.

\item[\rpsbox{breakspace}] This option sets whether the interpreter will treat a tilde character as a normal space. The default behaviour treats it as non-breakable.

\item[\rpsbox{trimfields}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will trim leading and trailing spaces from field values. The default behaviour does not trim spaces.

\item[\rpsbox{recordcount}] This option sets whether the record counting will be enabled. If activated, \rbox{bib2gls} will add record count fields to entries.

\item[\rpsbox{recordcountunit}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will add unit record count fields to entries. These fields can then be used with special commands.

\item[\rpsbox{cite}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will treat citation instances found in the \rbox{aux} file as though it was actually an ignored record.

\item[\rpsbox{verbose}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will be executed in verbose mode. When enabled, the application will write extra information to the terminal and transcript file. The default behaviour runs in silent mode.

\item[\rpsbox{merge}] This option sets whether the program will merge \rbox{wrglossary} counter records. If disabled, one may end up with duplicate page numbers in the list of entry locations, but linking to different parts of the page.

\item[\rpsbox{uniscript}] This option sets whether text superscript and subscript will use the corresponding Unicode characters if available.

\item[\abox{packages}] This option instructs the interpreter to assume the packages from the provided list have been used by the document.

\item[\abox{ignore}] This option instructs \rbox{bib2gls} to skip the check for any package from the provided list when parsing the corresponding log file.

\item[\abox{custom}] This option instructs the interpreter to parse the package files from the provided list. The package files need to be quite simple.

\item[\abox{mapformats}] This option takes a list and sets up the rule of precedence for partial location matches. Each element from the provided list must be another list of exactly two entries representing a conflict resolution.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{biber}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{biber}, the backend bibliography processor for \rbox{biblatex}, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{bibtex8}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{bibtex8}, an enhanced, portable C version of \rbox{bibtex}, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string. It is important to note that this tool can read a character set file containing encoding details.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}

\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{bibtexu}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs the \rbox{bibtexu} program, an enhanced version of \rbox{bibtex} with Unicode support and language features, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{clean}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule removes the provided file reference through the underlying system command, which can be \rbox{rm} in a Unix environment or \rbox{del} in Microsoft Windows. As a security lock, this rule will always throw an error if \mtbox{currentFile} is equal to \mtbox{getOriginalFile}, so the main file reference cannot be removed. It is highly recommended to use the special \abox{files} parameter to indicate removal candidates. Alternatively, a list of file extensions can be provided as well. Be mindful that the security lock also applies to file removals based on extensions.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{extensions}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of extensions and constructs a new list of removals commands according to the base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with each extension from the original list as suffixes. Keep in mind that, if the special \abox{files} parameter is used with this option, the resulting list will contain the cartesian product of file base names and extensions. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\begin{messagebox}{Better safe than sorry!}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
% TODO fix reference
When in doubt, always remember that the \opbox{{-}dry-run} command line option is your friend! As seen in Section~\ref{foo}, on page~\pageref{foo}, this option makes \arara\ go through all the motions of running tasks and subtasks, but with no actual calls. It is a very useful feature for testing the sequence of removal commands without actually losing your files! Also, as good practice, always write plain, simple, understandable \rbox{clean} directives and use as many as needed in your \TeX\ documents.
\end{messagebox}
\end{description}

\item[\rulebox{csplain}{Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs the \rbox{csplain} engine, a conservative extension of Knuth's plain \TeX\ with direct processing characters and hyphenation patterns for Czech and Slovak, on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. When such option is omitted, \TeX\ will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\povalue{nonstopmode}] In this mode, the diagnostic message will appear on the terminal, but there is no possibility of user interaction just like in batch mode, previously described.

\item[\povalue{scrollmode}] In this mode, as the name indicates, \TeX\ will stop only for missing files to input or if proper keyboard input is necessary. \TeX\ fixes errors itself.

\item[\povalue{errorstopmode}] In this mode, \TeX\ will stop at each error, asking for proper user intervention. This is the most user interactive mode available.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{shell}] This option sets whether the possibility of running underlying system commands from within \TeX\ is activated.

\item[\rpsbox{synctex}] This option sets whether \rbox{synctex}, an input and output synchronization feature that allows navigation from source to typeset material and vice versa, available in most \TeX\ engines, is actived.

\item[\rpsbox{draft}] This option sets whether the draft mode, i.e, a mode that produces no output, so the engine can check the syntax, is activated.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.
\end{description}

\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{datatooltk}{Nicola Talbot, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{datatooltk}, an application that creates \rbox{data­tool} databases in raw for­mat from several structured data formats, in batch mode.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{output}] This option provides the database name to be saved as output. To guard against accidentally overwriting a document file, \rbox{datatooltk} now forbids the \rbox{tex} extension for output files.

\item[\abox{csv}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from the \rbox{csv} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{sep}] This option specifies the character used to separate values in the \rbox{csv} file. Defaults to a comma.

\item[\abox{delim}] This option specifies the character used to delimit values in the \rbox{csv} file. Defaults to a double quote.

\item[\abox{name}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the label reference of the newly created database according to the provided value.

\item[\abox{sql}] This option imports data from an \gls{SQL} database where the provided value refers to a proper \rbox{select} \gls{SQL} statement.

\item[\abox{sqldb}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the \gls{SQL} database according to the provided value.

\item[\abox{sqluser}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the \gls{SQL} user according to the provided value.

\item[\rpbox{noconsole}{gui}] This action dictates the password request action if such information was not provided earlier. If there is no console available, the action is determined by the following values:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{error}] As the name indicates, this action issues an error when no password was previously provided through the proper option.

\item[\povalue{stdin}] This action requests the password via the standard input stream, which is less secure than using a console.

\item[\povalue{gui}] This action displays a dialog box in which the user can enter the password for the \gls{SQL} database.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{probsoln}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data in the \rbox{probsoln} format from the file name provided as value.

\item[\abox{input}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data in the \rbox{datatool} format from the file name provided as value.

\item[\abox{sort}] This option, as the name indicates, sorts the database according to the column whose label is provided as value.

\item[\abox{sortlocale}] This option, as the name indicates, sorts the database according to alphabetical order rules of the locale provided as value.

\item[\rpsbox{sortcase}] This option sets whether strings will be sorted using case sensitive comparison. The default behaviour is case insensitive.

\item[\abox{seed}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the random generator seed to the provided value. The seed is cleared if an empty value is provided.

\item[\rpsbox{shuffle}] This option sets whether the database will be properly shuffled. Shuffle is always performed after sort, regardless of the option order.

\item[\rpsbox{csvheader}] This option sets whether the \rbox{csv} file has a header row. The
spreadsheet import functions also use this setting.

\item[\rpsbox{debug}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the debug mode of \rbox{datatooltk} is activated. The debug mode is disabled by default.

\item[\rpsbox{owneronly}] This option sets whether read and write permissions when saving \rbox{dbtex} files should be defined for the owner only. This option has no effect on some operating systems.

\item[\rpsbox{maptex}] This option sets whether \TeX\ special characters will be properly mapped when importing data from \rbox{csv} files or \gls{SQL} databases.

\item[\abox{xls}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from a Microsoft Excel \rbox{xls} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{ods}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from an Open Document Spreadsheet \rbox{ods} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{sheet}] This option specifies the sheet to select from the Excel workbook or Open Document Spreadsheet. This may either be an index or the name of the sheet.

\item[\abox{filterop}] This option specifies the logical operator to be associated with a given filter. Filtering is always performed after sorting and shuffling. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{or}\hfill\hphantom{w}] This value, as the name indicates, use the logical \rbox{or} operator when filtering. This is the default behaviour. Note that this value has no effect if only one filter is supplied.

\item[\povalue{and}] This value, as the name indicates, use the logical \rbox{and} operator when filtering. Note that this value has no effect if only one filter is supplied.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{filters}] This option takes a list and sets up a sequence of filters. Each element from the provided list must be another list of exactly three entries representing a key, an operator and a value, respectively.

\item[\abox{truncate}] This option truncates the database to the number of rows provided as value. Truncation is always performed after any sorting, shuffling and filtering, but before column removal.

\item[\rulebox{dvipdfmx}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{dvipdfmx}, an extended version of \rbox{dvipdfm} cre­ated to sup­port multibyte char­ac­ter en­cod­ings and large char­ac­ter sets for East Asian lan­guages, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with the \rbox{dvi} suffix, generating a Portable Document Format \rbox{pdf} file.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the output name for the generated \rbox{pdf} file. There is no need to provide an extension, as the value is always normalized with \mtbox{getBasename} such that only the name without the associated extension is used. The base name of the current file reference is used as default value.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.
\end{description}

\item[\rulebox{dvipdfm}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{dvipdfm}, a command line utility for file format translation, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with the \rbox{dvi} suffix, generating a Portable Document Format \rbox{pdf} file.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the output name for the generated \rbox{pdf} file. There is no need to provide an extension, as the value is always normalized with \mtbox{getBasename} such that only the name without the associated extension is used. The base name of the current file reference is used as default value.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{dvipspdf}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{dvips} in order to obtain a corresponding \rbox{ps} file from the initial \rbox{dvi} reference, and then runs \rbox{ps2pdf} on the previously generated \rbox{ps} file in order to obtain a \rbox{pdf} file. Note that all base names are acquired from the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) and used to construct the resulting files.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the output name for the generated \rbox{pdf} file. There is no need to provide an extension, as the value is always normalized with \mtbox{getBasename} such that only the name without the associated extension is used. The base name of the current file reference is used as default value.

\item[\abox{options1}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the \rbox{dvips} program call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\abox{options2}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the \rbox{ps2pdf} program call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{frontespizio}{Francesco Endrici, Enrico Gregorio, Paulo Cereda}] This rule automates the steps required by the \rbox{frontespizio} package in order to help Italian user generate frontispiece to their thesis. First and foremost, the frontispiece is generated. If \rbox{latex} is used an underlying engine, there is an additional intermediate conversion step to a proper \rbox{eps} file. Finally, the final document is compiled.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpbox{engine}{pdflatex}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to be used for both compilations (the frontispiece and the document itself). Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{latex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{latex} for both compilations (frontispiece and document).

\item[\povalue{pdflatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{pdflatex} for both compilations (frontispiece and document).

\item[\povalue{lualatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{lualatex} for both compilations (frontispiece and document).
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{shell}] This option sets whether the possibility of running underlying system commands from within the selected \TeX\ engine is activated.

\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. When such option is omitted, \TeX\ will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\rulebox{indent}{Chris Hughes, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{latexindent}, a Perl script that indents \TeX\ files according to an indentation scheme, on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference. Environments, including those with alignment delimiters, and commands, including those that can split braces and brackets across lines, are usually handled correctly by the script.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpsbox{silent}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the script will operate in silent mode, in which no output is given to the terminal.

\item[\rpsbox{overwrite}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the \mtbox{currentFile} reference will be overwritten. If activated, a copy will be made before the actual indentation process. 

\item[\abox{trace}] This option, as the name indicates, enables the script tracing mode, such that a verbose output will be given to the \rbox{indent.log} log file. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{default}] This value, as the name indicates, refers to the default tracing level. Note that, especially for large files, this value does affect performance of the script.

\item[\povalue{complete}] This value, as the name indicates, refers to the detailed, complete tracing level. Note that, especially for large files, performance of the script will be significantly affected when this value is used.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{screenlog}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether \rbox{latexindent} will output the log file to the screen, as well as to the specified log file.

\item[\rpsbox{modifylinebreaks}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the script will modify line breaks, according to specifications written in a configuration file.

\item[\abox{cruft}] This option sets the provided value as a cruft location in which the script will write backup and log files. The default behaviour sets the working directory as cruft location.

\item[\abox{logfile}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the log file generated by \rbox{latexindent} according to the provided value.

\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the output file. Please note that this option has higher priority over some switches, so options like \abox{overwrite} will be ignored by the underlying script.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual script call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\abox{settings}] This option, as the name indicates, dictates the indentation settings to be applied in the current script execution. Two possible values are available:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{local}] This value, as the name implies, acts a switch to indicate a local configuration. In this scenario, the script will look for a proper settings file in the same directory as the \mtbox{currentFile} reference and add the corresponding content to the indentation scheme. Optionally, a file location can be specified as well. Please refer to the \abox{where} option for more details on such feature.

\item[\povalue{onlydefault}] This value, as the name indicates, ignores any local configuration, so the script will resort to the default indentation behaviour.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{where}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the file location containing the indentation settings according to the provided value. This option can only be used if, and only if, \rbox[cyan]{local} is set as value for the \abox{settings} option, otherwise the rule will throw an error.

\item[\abox{clean}] This option, as the name indicates, removes all temporary files generated after a sequence of intermediate calls for document generation. Two possible values are available:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{all}] This value, as the name indicates, removes all temporary, intermediate files, as well as resulting, final formats such as PostScript and Portable Document File. Only relevant source files are kept.

\item[\povalue{partial}] This value, as the name indicates, removes all temporary, intermediate files and keeps the resulting, final formats such as PostScript and Portable Document File.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{engine}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine of \rbox{latexmk} to be used for the compilation sequence. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{latex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine of the script to \rbox{latex} for the compilation sequence.

\item[\povalue{pdflatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine of the script to \rbox{pdflatex} for the compilation sequence.

\item[\povalue{xelatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine of the script to \rbox{xelatex} for the compilation sequence.

\item[\povalue{lualatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine of the script to \rbox{lualatex} for the compilation sequence.

\item[\abox{program}] This option, as the name suggests, sets the \TeX\ engine according to the provided value. It is important to note that this option has higher priority over \abox{engine} values, so the latter will be discarded.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual script call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{latex}{Marco Daniel, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs the \rbox{latex} \TeX\ engine on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference, generating a corresponding file in a device independent format.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. When such option is omitted, \TeX\ will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\povalue{nonstopmode}] In this mode, the diagnostic message will appear on the terminal, but there is no possibility of user interaction just like in batch mode, previously described.

\item[\povalue{scrollmode}] In this mode, as the name indicates, \TeX\ will stop only for missing files to input or if proper keyboard input is necessary. \TeX\ fixes errors itself.

\item[\povalue{errorstopmode}] In this mode, \TeX\ will stop at each error, asking for proper user intervention. This is the most user interactive mode available.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{shell}] This option sets whether the possibility of running underlying system commands from within \TeX\ is activated.

\item[\rpsbox{synctex}] This option sets whether \rbox{synctex}, an input and output synchronization feature that allows navigation from source to typeset material and vice versa, available in most \TeX\ engines, is actived.

\item[\rpsbox{draft}] This option sets whether the draft mode, i.e, a mode that produces no output, so the engine can check the syntax, is activated.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as value.

\item[\rulebox{makeglossarieslite}{Marco Daniel, Nicola Talbot, Paulo Cereda}] This rule runs \rbox{makeglossaries-lite}, a lightweight Lua script designed for use with \TeX\ documents that work with the \rbox{glossaries} package. All the information required to be passed to the relevant indexing application should also be contained in the auxiliary file. The script takes the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as mandatory argument.
