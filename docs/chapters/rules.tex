\chapter{The official rule pack}
\label{chap:theofficialrulepack}

\arara\ ships with a pack of default rules, placed inside a special subdirectory named \abox[araracolour]{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox[araracolour]{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). This chapter introduces the official rules, including proper listings and descriptions of associated parameters whenever applied. Note that such rules work out of the shelf, without any special installation, configuration or modification.

As seen in Section~\ref{foo}, on page~\pageref{foo}, the default rule path can be extended to include a list of directories in which our tool should search for rules. However, if you believe your rule is comprehensive enough and deserves to be in the official pack, please contact us! We will be more  than happy to discuss the inclusion of your rule in forthcoming updates.
