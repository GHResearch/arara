# arara

`arara` is a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. It gives you subsidies to enhance your TeX experience. The tool is an effort to provide a concise way to automate the daily TeX workflow for users and also package writers. Users might write their own rules when the provided ones do not suffice.

## Basic use

To use `arara`, you need to tell it what to do. Unlike most other tools, you give `arara` these 'directives' in the document itself â€“ usually near the top.  So to run `pdflatex` once on your document, you should say something like:

```tex
% arara: pdflatex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!
\end{document}
```

Now when you run `arara my-file`, that directive (`% arara: ...`) will be seen and carried out as described by the `pdflatex` rule.  You can read more about rules and directives in the [user manual](http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/arara/doc/arara-usermanual.pdf). In addition to documenting all of the rules that come standard with `arara`, its manual gives a detailed explanation of how `arara` works, how to create and use your own rules, and how to integrate the tool into the common TeX IDEs.

> The documentation link presented above points to the official user manual of `arara` 3.0a in PDF format, available directly from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). See next section for a note on the documentation status for the upcoming version 4.0 (still in progress).

## Current status

The `arara` team is working on the new 4.0 version. The code is ready and we are now focusing on rules, translations and the documentation itself. It might take a while since a lot of things have changed since version 3.0, so the manual has to be completely rewritten. Hopefully, we will release it soon. `:)`

- *Current TL version:* 3.0a (codebase is available in the [releases](https://github.com/cereda/arara/releases) section)
- *Development/upcoming version:* 4.0 (the repository itself holds the last changes)

## Build status

`arara` uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as a hosted continuous integration service. For each and every commit, we can see in real time the build status of our application checked against the following Java VM vendors:

- OpenJDK 6.0
- OpenJDK 7.0
- Oracle Java 7.0
- Oracle Java 8.0

More JVM's might be added soon. It is worth noting that `arara` is designed and built to be Java 5.0 compliant, so if you have an old JVM, it is almost sure that you will be able to run our beloved tool in it without any problems.

## Downloads

Binary releases are powered by Bintray and not available in the repository anymore. You can [click here](https://bintray.com/cereda/arara/installers/_latestVersion) or use the button below to get access to the current 3.0 release. Note that you need Java to run both the installer and `arara` itself.

*Download:* [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/cereda/arara/installers/images/download.svg?version=3.0) ](https://bintray.com/cereda/arara/installers/3.0/link)

If you want to try out the development version, you need to build it from source. It is actually a straightforward process: just clone this repository, go to the `application/` directory and run `mvn assembly:assembly` (you need [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for this); you'll get the resulting `.jar` file in a `target/` directory. Have fun!
