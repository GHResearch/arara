`arara` is a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. It gives you subsidies to enhance your TeX experience. The tool is an effort to provide a concise way to automate the daily TeX workflow for users and also package writers. Users might write their own rules when the provided ones do not suffice.

## Basic use

To use `arara`, you need to tell it what to do. Unlike most other tools, you give `arara` these _directives_ in the document itself â€“ usually near the top.  So to run `pdflatex` once on your document, you should say something like:

```tex
% arara: pdflatex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!
\end{document}
```

Now when you run `arara myfile`, that directive (`% arara: ...`) will be seen and carried out as described by the `pdflatex` rule.  You can read more about rules and directives in the [user manual](http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/arara/doc/arara-usermanual.pdf). In addition to documenting all of the rules that come standard with `arara`, its manual gives a detailed explanation of how `arara` works, how to create and use your own rules, and how to integrate the tool into the common TeX IDEs.

## Versions

`arara` uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as a hosted continuous integration service. For each and every commit, we can see in real time the build status of our application checked against a range of Java VM vendors. It is worth noting that the current series is designed and built to be Java 5.0 compliant, so if you have an old JVM, it is almost sure that you will be able to run `arara` in it without any problems.

If you want to try out the development version, you need to build it from source. It is actually a straightforward process: just clone this repository, go to the `application/` directory and run `mvn assembly:assembly` (you need [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for this); you'll get the resulting `.jar` file in a `target/` directory. Have fun!
